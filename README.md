# PHPQA
## By [Edmonds Commerce](https://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk)


## Version 3 Updates

You should update your phpunit.xml file to use `        printerClass="\PHPUnit\Util\TestDox\CliTestDoxPrinter"`

[see ./phpunit.xml](./phpunit.xml)


## Introduction

PHPQA is a quality assurance pipeline written in BASH that can be run both on the desktop as part of your development process and then also as part of a continuous integration (CI) pipeline.

It runs tools in a logical order and will fail as quickly as possible.

PHPQA has only been tested on Linux.

## Installing

You can follow dev-master which should generally be pretty stable (all features are developed in feature branches and must pass CI before making it into master. Alternatively if you want real stability, you can track a release version of your choice.

```bash
composer require edmondscommerce/phpqa:dev-master@dev --dev
```

Your project's `composer.json` needs to specify a bin folder. If it's not already present, add this:

```
    ...
    "config": {
        "bin-dir": "bin"
    }
    ...
``` 

You will also need xdebug installed to get coverage.

## Running

To run the full pipline, simply execute in your BASH terminal: 
```bash
./bin/qa 
```

### Usage:

```
$ ./bin/qa -h

Usage:
bin/qa [-t tool to run ] [ -p path to scan ]

Defaults to using all tools and scanning whole project based on platform

 - use -h to see this help

 - use -p to specify a specific path to scan

 - use -t to specify a single tool:
     psr|psr4         psr4 validation
     com|composer     composer validation
     st|stricttypes   strict types validation
     lint|phplint     phplint
     stan|phpstan     phpstan
     unit|phpunit     phpunit
     infect|infection infection
     md|messdetector  php mess detector
     ma|markdown      markdown validation
     bf|phpbf         php beautifier and fixer
     cs|phpcs         php code sniffer
     l|loc            lines of code and other stats


```

By default, PHPQA will run against the entire project root.

### Single Tool:

If you want to run a single tool, use the `-t` option. See the usage above to get the shortcuts for the tools

```bash
./bin/qa -t stan
```

### Specified Path:

Some of the tools allow us to restrict the scan to a specified path. To specify the path, use the `-p` option.

```bash 
./bin/qa -p ./src/specified/path.php
```

### Combined

You can combine both options

```bash 
./bin/qa -t stan -p ./src/specified/path.php
```
 
## Configuration

Please see the [Configuration docs](./docs/configuration.md)

## The Pipeline

Please see the [Pipeline docs](./docs/pipeline.md)

## The QA Tools

For full details and configuration instructions for all fo the tools, please see the [PHPQA Tools](./docs/phpqa-tools.md)

## Platform Detection

PHPQA comes with a set of generic tools and configs, but also has some inbuilt profiles.

Information on how this works can be found on the [platform detection page](docs/platform-detection.md)

Specific platforms' docs are at:

- [Magento 2](./docs/magento2.md)
- [Laravel and Lumen](./docs/laravellumen.md)

## Using for Continuous Integration (CI)

Please see the [CI docs](./docs/ci.md)

## Git Hooks

Have a look in [gitHooks](./gitHooks) for git hooks that can be used in your project

The suggested way to use these is to symlink. Note that your actual git hook should not include the `.bash` file extension

To use the `pre-commit` hook, for example, you would do:

```bash
#cd to project root
cd /var/www/project/root

#cd to hooks folder
cd .git/hooks/

#create relative symlink
ln -s ../../vendor/edmondscommerce/phpqa/gitHooks/pre-commit.bash pre-commit
```

Then ensure the hook is executable by running it:

``` bash
#cd to project root
cd /var/www/project/root

./git/hooks/pre-commit
```

And you should then see
